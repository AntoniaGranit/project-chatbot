# TravelBot

This is my interpretation of the chatbot project for Technigo. This project was supposed to help us get a deeper understanding of the basics of Javascript (functions, event listeners and so on). I had a lot of fun tinkering with it, and I think it turned out really well. On mobile it's a bit questionable, but it might be an iPhone/Safari issue.

I added a video background using the technique my group had learned during the bootcamp's intro days. I also added sound effects (these sometimes work well and sometimes not that well, I think it's due to the length of the soundbytes themselves) and changed the look of the icons, buttons, and conversation bubbles.

## The problem

I started by going through Technigo's chatbot's javascript. It was quite daunting in the beginning but as I studied it I started understanding the logic. At first I went a completely different route and started from an event listener, but I realized that would be too complicated for me to figure out on my own so I tried sticking to the example site's logic as much as possible.

I'm still struggling with the logic of setTimeouts though. It seems that there are certain ways you absolutely cannot use them, because when I try the chat section is completely blank. I'm sure I'll figure this out as the bootcamp goes on, though. I would've also really liked to add a "shaking" effect to the icons when the chat bubbles pop up so it looks like they're talking, but I think that's too advanced. I would've also liked to add a "typewriter" effect to the bot's first message so it looks like it's being typed out in real time, but again, too advanced at this point in time.
